As expected loss is an additive property and the price is modeled as a linear function of the expected loss it does not matter if we pool the countries or not. Futhermore, there is also no change in price when using the IBRD method. This is not as trivial as for the regression model, but based on the 3D-plot shown during the presentation pooling countries with high losses should not result in any change regarding the price. \n",
